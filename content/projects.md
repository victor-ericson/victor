# SelfWorth
Currently working on setting up an Asset Management website to help me better understand where my money is going, what my (lack of) net worth is but arguably more crucially - help me gain a slightly better understanding of the technologies of today's Software Engineers.

Current project stack:
* Go (GORM, Gin)
* SQLite
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Terraform
* React

# [Carspotter](https://github.com/lundellstef/Carspotter){:class="custom-link"}
* As part of a course in software engineering, a group of students and I developed an app for car spotters in Stockholm. Created in Flutter together with Firebase. Also used the Plate Recognizer API to help us retrieve car information and blur license plates.
