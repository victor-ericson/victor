# [Carspotter](https://github.com/lundellstef/Carspotter){:class="custom-link"}
* As part of a course in software engineering, a group of students and I developed an app for car spotters in Stockholm. Created in Flutter together with Firebase. Also used the Plate Recognizer API to help us retrieve car information and blur license plates.
